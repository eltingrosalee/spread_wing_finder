# spread_wing_finder
This app has been created to assist in finding spread wings available in museum collections that can be used for many projects, ours focusing on full-spectrum photography. The data for this spreadsheet is from Vertnet, and will be occassionally updated. The code can work with other databases as long as they have corresponding data formats.
